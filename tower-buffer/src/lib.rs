//! Buffer requests when the inner service is out of capacity.
//!
//! Buffering works by spawning a new task that is dedicated to pulling requests
//! out of the buffer and dispatching them to the inner service. By adding a
//! buffer and a dedicated task, the `Buffer` layer in front of the service can
//! be `Clone` even if the inner service is not.

                    //  - If poll_next_msg returned Ready(Some) and poll_ready() returned NotReady,
                    //    we should return NotReady here as well, since the service can't make
                    //    progress yet to accept the message.
                    //  - If poll_next_msg returned Ready(Some) and poll_ready() returned Ready,
                    //    we'd have continued, so that can't be the case.
                    //
                    // Thus, in all cases when we get to this point, we should return NotReady.
