# Tower

Tower is a library of modular and reusable components for building robust
networking clients and servers.

## Overview

Tower aims to make it as easy as possible to build robust networking clients and
servers. It is protocol agnostic, but is designed around a request / response
pattern. If your protocol is entirely stream based, Tower may not be a good fit.
