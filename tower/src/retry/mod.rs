    /// order to retry the request in the event of a failure. If the inner
    /// `Service` type does not implement `Clone`, the [`Buffer`] middleware
    /// can be added to make any `Service` cloneable.

    /// The `Policy` must also implement `Clone`. This middleware will
    /// clone the policy for each _request session_. This means a new clone
    /// of the policy will be created for each initial request and any subsequent
    /// retries of that request. Therefore, any state stored in the `Policy` instance
    /// is for that request session only. In order to share data across request
    /// sessions, that shared state may be stored in an [`Arc`], so that all clones
    /// of the `Policy` type reference the same instance of the shared state.
