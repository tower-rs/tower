/// Declaratively construct Service values.
///
/// `ServiceBuilder` provides a [builder-like interface][builder] for composing
/// layers and a connection, where the latter is modeled by a `MakeService`. The
/// builder produces either a new `Service` or `MakeService`,
/// depending on whether `service` or `make_service` is called.
///
/// # Services and MakeServices
///
/// - A [`Service`](tower_service::Service) is a trait representing an
///   asynchronous function of a request to a response. It is similar to `async
///   fn(Request) -> Result<Response, Error>`.
///
/// - A [`MakeService`](tower_util::MakeService) is a trait creating specific
///   instances of a `Service`
///
/// # Service
///
/// A `Service` is typically bound to a single transport, such as a TCP
/// connection.  It defines how _all_ inbound or outbound requests are handled
/// by that connection.
///
/// # MakeService
///
/// Since a `Service` is bound to a single connection, a `MakeService` allows
/// for the creation of _new_ `Service`s that'll be bound to _different_
/// different connections.  This is useful for servers, as they require the
/// ability to accept new connections.
///
/// Resources that need to be shared by all `Service`s can be put into a
/// `MakeService`, and then passed to individual `Service`s when `make_service`
/// is called.
///
/// [builder]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html
///
/// # Order
///
/// The order in which layers are added impacts how requests are handled. Layers
/// that are added first will be called with the request first. The argument to
/// `service` or `make_service` will be last to see the request.
///
/// ```
/// # use tower::Service;
/// # use tower::builder::ServiceBuilder;
/// # fn dox<T>(my_service: T)
/// # where T: Service<()> + Send + 'static,
/// # T::Future: Send,
/// # T::Error: Into<Box<::std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>,
/// # {
/// ServiceBuilder::new()
///     .buffer(100)
///     .concurrency_limit(10)
///     .service(my_service)
/// # ;
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, the buffer layer receives the request first followed
/// by `concurrency_limit`. `buffer` enables up to 100 request to be in-flight
/// **on top of** the requests that have already been forwarded to the next
/// layer. Combined with `concurrency_limit`, this allows up to 110 requests to be
/// in-flight.
///
/// ```
/// # use tower::Service;
/// # use tower::builder::ServiceBuilder;
/// # fn dox<T>(my_service: T)
/// # where T: Service<()> + Send + 'static,
/// # T::Future: Send,
/// # T::Error: Into<Box<::std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>,
/// # {
/// ServiceBuilder::new()
///     .concurrency_limit(10)
///     .buffer(100)
///     .service(my_service)
/// # ;
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The above example is similar, but the order of layers is reversed. Now,
/// `concurrency_limit` applies first and only allows 10 requests to be in-flight
/// total.
///
