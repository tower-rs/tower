Tower is a library of modular and reusable components for building robust
networking clients and servers.

## Overview

Tower aims to make it as easy as possible to build robust networking clients and
servers. It is protocol agnostic, but is designed around a request / response
pattern. If your protocol is entirely stream based, Tower may not be a good fit.

## Project Layout

Tower consists of a number of components, each of which live in their own sub
crates.

* [`tower-service`]: The foundational traits upon which Tower is built
  ([docs][ts-docs]).

* [`tower-balance`]: A load balancer. Load is balanced across a number of
  services ([docs][tb-docs]).

* [`tower-buffer`]: A buffering middleware. If the inner service is not ready to
  handle the next request, `tower-buffer` stores the request in an internal
  queue ([docs][tbuf-docs]).

* [`tower-discover`]: Service discovery abstraction ([docs][td-docs]).

* [`tower-filter`]: Middleware that conditionally dispatch requests to the inner
  service based on a predicate ([docs][tf-docs]);

* [`tower-in-flight-limit`]: Middleware limiting the number of requests that
  are in-flight for the inner service ([docs][tifl-docs]).

* [`tower-mock`]: Testing utility for mocking a `Service`. This is useful for
  testing middleware implementations ([docs][tm-docs]);

* [`tower-rate-limit`]: Middleware limiting the number of requests to the inner
  service over a period of time ([docs][trl-docs]).

* [`tower-reconnect`]: Middleware that automatically reconnects the inner
  service when it becomes degraded ([docs][tre-docs]).

* [`tower-retry`]: Middleware that retries requests based on a given `Policy`
  ([docs][tretry-docs]).

* [`tower-timeout`]: Middleware that applies a timeout to requests
  ([docs][tt-docs]).

* [`tower-util`]: Miscellaneous additional utilities for Tower
  ([docs][tu-docs]).

* [`tower-watch`]: A middleware that rebinds the inner service each time a watch
  is notified ([docs][tw-docs]).

## Status

Currently, only [`tower-service`], the foundational trait, has been released to
crates.io. The rest of the library will be following shortly.
