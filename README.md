## Overview

Tower aims to make it as easy as possible to build robust networking clients and
servers. It is protocol agnostic, but is designed around a request / response
pattern. If your protocol is entirely stream based, Tower may not be a good fit.

## Status

Currently, `tower 0.3` is released on crates. We are currently working on cleaning
up the codebase and adding more documentation. You can follow our progress in
this [issue](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower/issues/431).
